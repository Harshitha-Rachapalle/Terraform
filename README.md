# Terraform

Terraform is a universal approach where it supports all cloud providers. Terraform is provided by hashicorp. so we use hashicorp configuration language(HCL).

**Configuration File**: Terraform uses configuration files (often with a .tf extension) to define the desired infrastructure state. These files specify providers, resources, variables, and other settings. The primary configuration file is usually named **main.tf**, but you can use multiple configuration files as well.

To create main.tf refer in google as terraform aws
